@idea GPT-4:

  Error Handling: Right now, your bot might crash if it encounters an error it doesn't know 
  how to handle. You could add some global error handling to your bot to catch these errors 
  and respond appropriately.

  Command Checks: You're checking if the user has administrator permissions in your reload 
  and sync commands. You could use commands.has_permissions decorator to do this check, 
  which would make your code a bit cleaner.
