On use of C++ from python

Functions must be wrapped with < extern "C" { ... } >

Compilation:
    g++ -shared -o main.so -fPIC main.cpp

From Python:
  import ctypes

  lib = ctypes.CDLL("./cpp/main.so") -> Load shared library

  (supposing in the lib there is a function declared "const int* foo()")
  lib.foo.restype = ctypes.c_int_p -> Set return type (c for constant, p for pointer)

  result = lib.foo() -> Call function
